Summary
---
This article talks about how copyright law is kind of the wrong thing to use when dealing with generative AI, especially because it makes everything more complicated and doesn’t actually solve the problems artists are worried about. You can find the link to it [here](https://yalelawjournal.org/forum/artificial-why-copyright-is-not-the-right-policy-tool-to-deal-with-generative-ai)

So What's Going On?

“Okay…what did I just read?” – Me. That was me after reading this article (partly because I was very tired) and realizing just how messy the whole AI copyright debate is. I’ve seen a lot of AI online (and perhaps used it a pinch), but I didn’t really think about what goes on underneath the hood or how anyone decides who “owns” what. Apparently, it’s way more complicated than “the AI made it, so it owns it,” or “the human typed the prompt, so they own it.” The article is basically saying that copyright law, as it is right now, wasn’t built for this and stretching it to fit AI is like using duct tape to fix a sinking boat. Might work for a second, but you’re sinking either way. That is unless you are a professionnel du ruban adhésif. 

What surprised me is how much the author talked about how everything from creativity, to ethics, to the entire Internet, gets tangled up when we try to 'invite' AI into copyright law. It just means we’re all fighting the wrong battle here...Here are my responses to some discussion questions found in the article.

Discussion Questions
---
#### How should authors be compensated, and under which circumstances?

Honestly, this is a really hard question, and the article basically says copyright isn’t the way to do it. I think authors should get compensated when their work is used to directly train a model—especially if the AI ends up mimicking their style so well that you can’t tell who made what anymore. But the tricky part is figuring out how to compensate them. Are we talking royalties? A one-time fee? A tax? I have no idea. What I do know is that AI companies are making a lot of money, and the artists whose work fueled the model are getting absolutely nothing. That feels, and is, wrong. The article hints at alternative solutions (like maybe government incentives), but it doesn’t give a clean answer. Honestly, there might not be one yet.

#### Is training with unlicensed works a fair use, or an infringing one?

This is where everything gets messy. The article kind of sidesteps the exact answer and instead spends a lot of time explaining why copyright law wasn’t built for this dilemma in the first place. My personal take? I don’t think scraping millions of images without permission and then reverse-engineering someone’s style should be considered “fair use.” That feels like saying, “I didn’t copy your painting, I was just really influenced at the pixel-level by it.” Same vibe. But at the same time, if we declare all training on unlicensed data infringement, then basically every AI system today becomes illegal overnight. So the courts are in a lose-lose situation. Fun!

#### Are the outputs generated by GAI original or derivative works?

This is honestly impossible to answer cleanly. The article explains that AI outputs are created from statistical patterns, not copied chunks, so technically they’re “new.” But they’re also shaped entirely by the training data, so they’re not completely original either. They sit in this weird in-between zone—like creative soup. And because we can’t consistently tell AI art apart from human art, the whole “originality” concept kind of starts to fall apart. My answer? They’re original-ish. Like off-brand cereal that’s legally different from Cheerios but we all know exactly where the idea came from. 

#### Should the outputs be entitled to some form of copyright protection? If so, how should we deal with AI authorship?

My first reaction is no as AI shouldn’t get copyright. It’s not conscious, it’s not intentional, and it’s not sitting there stressing about deadlines. But what about the human who typed the prompt? The article says that if the human’s contribution is “too small,” then they don’t get copyright either. So where does that leave us? Basically nowhere. The author even jokes that we might break copyright law itself by trying to force AI into it. My take is: if a human has meaningful input (not just “big blue bee”), then maybe they should get copyright. Otherwise, the image should probably be in the public domain. My other though is have a special type of copyright that makes people realize it was AI-generated and not just raw skill, but that sounds overly complicated. 

My New Question
---
If future AI becomes good enough to imitate any specific human’s style or voice perfectly, should people have the right to “opt out” of being imitated altogether, and if so, how would that even work?

I came up with this question because the article talks a lot about consent and how artists' work gets used to train these models without them knowing (Also because the "Dear Hank and John" podcast I listen to, touched upon this). So what happens when an AI can basically impersonate you artistically or literally? I think this question gets at the heart of the ethical problem, not just the legal one.

Conclusion
---
AI isn’t going anywhere, neither is my dead car right now... Copyright law, as the article puts it, is probably not going to save us, it’ll just tangle things up more than they already are. What we can do is stay aware, stay critical, and think about better tools (policy-wise and ethically) to handle what AI is bringing into the world. Because it’s a lot.

"In 2016 sculptor Anish Kapoor purchased the artistic rights to Vantablack, a material described as the “the darkest man-made substance.” The substance is made of carbon nanotubes, that reflect virtually no light...This month, his studio launched Blink, which is touted as the “blackest black ink” and is priced at $16 a bottle...Developed in direct response Kapoor’s Vantablack deal, the [developement of the world's pinkest pink] product came with a notice prohibiting the British-Indian sculptor [Anish Kapoor] – or anyone acting on his behalf – from purchasing it." - CNN

“The idea was if only one person can have Vantablack, what if everyone in the world can have the pink except that one person?” - Semple
