# Case Study: The Future of Employment with AI

## 1. Introduction
With every invention that has had an impact on the daily lives of people, artificial intelligence (AI) is no exception. If anything, AI might become the invention that has one of the most salient impacts on human life. Many people believe that artificial intelligence is still in its early stages of life. As the development of artificial intelligence continues to accelerate and grow at immeasurable speeds, questions arise at the stability of the job market and the increasing concentration of technological power. This case study examines the emerging risks of AI and how AI may reshape the future of employment and authority.

## 2. Background
While most people had not heard about artificial intelligence until 2020, AI has been around far longer than that. The earliest stages of AI are in what can be classified as the “Rule-Based” stage. The stage takes place from the years 1950-1970, some arguing the development commenced even earlier in the 40s. One of the highlights of the earliest models includes formal logic, which is an approach to represent concepts mathematically. These models lacked the ability to learn new information as the models relied solely on rules given when being programmed.

The second stage of artificial intelligence can be called the “Early Machine Learning” stage taking place from the year 1980-1990. The models being developed can now understand and ‘remember’ previous contexts to benefit the output of future responses. The second stage is where neural networks are introduced–inspired by the human brain and how it is structured. The machine learning aspect meant the models could improve their performance contingent on the amount and quality of data they were trained on. The stage where the early issues of the “black box” in AI emerge, where the models train and update themselves to the point where the developers are not particularly sure how the model works, but that it just does.

The third stage of AI models, taking place from 200-2010, can be thought of as the “No-Longer-Niche” stage. Models are being applied to more various domains. AI becomes more accessible to the typical person. This third stage is where people start seeing signs of artificial intelligence through things like Siri and voice recognition. 

The fourth stage is where, as of writing this in 2025, artificial intelligence is currently at. Starting from around 2010-2025/present, people start to see AI jump out of the shadows and start doing many things at unfathomable levels of uncanny. AI can now create music, write entire scripts for a musical, write code, and become one’s new best friend. The models are created with multi-dimensional neural networks called deep learning. The corpus, training data capacity, of the new language models are ginormous. “With 175 billion parameters, it represents one of the most sophisticated and largest language models to date.
