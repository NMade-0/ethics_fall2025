Governments are important stakeholders in the issue of AI-driven job displacement because they are responsible for protecting workers, regulating labor markets, and ensuring fair and ethical use of technology. As AI systems increasingly influence hiring, employment stability, and workplace practices, governments play a key role in setting policies that balance innovation with public welfare. This includes establishing labor protections, enforcing anti-discrimination laws, and promoting transparency in the use of automated decision-making systems.

At the same time, many governments struggle to keep pace with the rapid development of AI technologies. Regulatory gaps can allow companies to deploy AI systems without sufficient oversight, leaving workers vulnerable to harm. Without clear guidelines and enforcement mechanisms, AI adoption may exacerbate inequality and weaken job security. Governments therefore have an ethical responsibility to develop policies that support reskilling, accountability, and long-term job sustainability in an AI-driven economy.
