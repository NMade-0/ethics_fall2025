Task 1
---
## 1.
Superlative is a big word. Too big for my head. Imma use a different word that works with my hip gen-z-ness, most vibey. So the blog post that was most vibey is this one--the last blog post. Why? Well, I tend to prefer creative writing over structed writing, and this one I don't have to read or listen to anything before writing, and 'educating' readers on my perspective. I have the the freedom of a bald eagle perched on a high tree drinking vodka. (I've only had vodka once, but I don't drink as far as you know.) With the lowkey vibey hipness of this article, it easily tops the cake with being the most vibey. 

## 2.
As for the second-most vibey post, I really "enjoyed" blog post 6, where I talked about the addicitve behaviour of ai companions. While I can't say I enjoyed writing the post, I really did enjoy listening, that's right listening, to the article about it. (I must prefer to listen to articles than read them--works better with my brain). As for how reflecting on this help me notice changes in my writing and/or thinking; it doesn't. It reminds me of the article and the issues with ai influencing harm in youth, and other demographics. I am sad to say, there was no epiphanies in writing this paragraph. If anything, I'm slightly worried for my grade for this post due to my dry humor.


## 3.
I significantly change my 2nd blog post. I had originally left out several points failing to make the connections between my arguments "perepectives" and the article. I made remarks that ended up being assumptions with too much ambiguity. So I fixed up those remarks, added in some polish and now it's flawless. By 'flawless' I mean, it will make my mom smile, not necessarily a writing tutor. I wish I could say I improved my writing skills at all, but I don't feel like I've learned a whole lot--similar to any required CS course after Data Structures. 

Task 2
---
## 1.
In lieu with the last paragraph, this course did about null in my writing skills. Granted, I can blame myself for not putting in the compositional effort. Aspects I struggled with were the following in no particular order: time, apathy in writing, attention span in long articles (why I like listening ones), apathy in analysis.

## 2.
Yes, mostly because I can more easily work with google docs than codespace. As for the difference between an online audience and a typical acedemic assignment, I am indifferent. What does one be by 'online audience'? All my typical homework is being graded online. The in-person reviews could very easily become the online audience. A typical paper, perhaps, has a typical outline with intro, body paragraphs, counter arguments, and conclusion. A blogpost using codespace has been a mess in the sence where I don't know how my paper will format, and don't mind just guessing until I see it later. 

## 3.
The only real habit I kept with this, asside from forgetting about them once I turn them in, is leaving a quote at the end of the posts. I like quotes, and we should be happy people can share their biggest lessons in life in under three lines of text.
