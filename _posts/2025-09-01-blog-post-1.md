Words by an optimist - AI as the Enemy

**I recommend reading this article first and coming up with your own perspectives and opions to AI, before reading my blog:**  
[AI—The good, the bad, and the scary](https://eng.vt.edu/magazine/stories/fall-2023/ai.html)

My Take
---
Reading an article on AI typically does a few things to my head—typically in the following order:

> 1: Damn, AI can do that!?
> 2: Well that's not good...
> 3: We're all dead

But, hey! After reading the article "AI—The good, the bad, and the scary," I had these thoughts run through my mind:

> 1: Damn, AI can do that!?
> 2: Well that's not good...
> 3: We're all dead

Okay I know, I know - call me an optimist - but I'm starting to think Stephen Hawking was onto something here when he said, "The developement of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race." The quote sends shivers down my spine. I mean, Hawking was a smart guy, you can tell because he wore glasses.

Anyway, if you can forget the rough edges of AI - and if I can forget the jumping spider on the window next to me - AI is actually quite beautiful;

## Why do I read these articles
Well, as a computer scientist, I like to know what is going on with artificial intelligence. It is important to me that I know the benefits and the risks with AI. I want to know what I am using when I ask and LLM for advice to solving an integral, or checking the syntax of a conditional in a coding language I haven't used in a while. If AI can solve my bug in my hundreds of lines of code and explain in detail what error I made, what and how much power does it really have? This article talked about these potentials and risks—interviewing people with different mediums of expertise.

## What are the real risks 
Well, I'm glad you asked! The biggest risks this article talked about are as followed in, what I believe, order from least risk to most risk:

- Stupdily good algorithms making the user stay on their phones, tvs, et cetera for longer and longer. I heard there is "$1 million prize to any team that could improve its recommendation algorithm, Cinematch, by at least 10%."

- We are relying more and more on AI. I bet you the $1 million prize that I am planning on winning from Netflix, there are Gen Alphas who have never wrote their own essays without using and LLM to write on for them. As a result, our independent decision-making and thinking skills are at risk for deteriorating in future generations.

- Job security and sustainability is at an all-time risk with AI. As a computer scientist, I want to find a job where I won't get replaced in three years by a more-effecient AI tool. Nor do I want my data and info stolen through manipulative implementations of AI. With AI, scam callers, scam emails, scam anything can become more convicing through the use of AI.

- HUGE CARBON FOOTPRINT! Aren't we already in a exponential state of global warming? AI needs energy to compute at data centers. Those data centers need a lot of electricity "and also require a significant amount of water for cooling purposes." 

- Malicious intent is something the article didn't discuss a whole lot about, but it is the very thing I fear the most with AI. This ties to the previous one, but this goes further in the sense that AI can be, and has been, implemented into weapons. 

## So what can we do? 
- The best thing we can do is to put our brains back in our heads, and to set all greeds aside and write strong and growing laws about the uses of AI, the killswitches of new technologies, the enforcement of copyright infringement of AI tools itself and others, the founding of more people in charge with big and tipping decisions in future steps of AI, and the better renewable practices of using and running AI to reduce the carbon footprint we have already created with it.


## Final words by the optimist

The second-worst thing that follows malicious use of AI, is the silence of those who know the very risks of it.
