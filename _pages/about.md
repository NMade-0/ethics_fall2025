Welcome, welcome! This page is meant to showcase my case study, podcasts, and blog posts reflecting on readings. I hope your day gets at least 1% better here, if not...I'm sorry I failed you


About Me
---
Well howdy! It's you favorite classmate Nicholas Magnusson! Apparently apart of these things:[Mathematics, and Computer Science Department. Here is a link to a very pathetic page about it:  (https://wp.stolaf.edu/mscs/) I'm earning my B.S in Wouldn't you know it!? Computer science, and a math, though I would prefer a concentration in math. Let's see...I had a reote internship where I worked on full-stack apple application developement. Kinda cool, though the app was about as boring of an app you could get with apps...(It was a survey app with no direct goal in particular) But hey! We got a successful beta test out into the world using App Store Connect!

Research 
---
Topics I am currently researching, are app development where I want to practice proper data management and security (like encrypted user accounts). I also like doing research in what I like to call "What-The-Hell-Am-I-Going-To-Do-With-My-Life," you can probably guess how that is going...

Interesting topics in ethics...I want to learn the ethics of ai and what it means to create ai tools that are aimed towards companies which lead to people losing their jobs and being replaced by the ai tool.

Personal Life

Well, let's see...I live 10 miles from canada, like I can bike to canada in under an hour. I want to make games and apps, but with ai tools coming out, it is very hard to motivate myself to learn this knowing it won't matter in a year or two. (I'm not pessimistic, you are!) Though, quantum mechanics sounds pretty dope too, and this is a newer field with LOTS of room to grow.I got three dogs, one cat, one grandma, one phone, ten fingers, 80 keys on my laptop (with a margin of error of 10, it's quite an eye sore to count them), and I'm a senior!
