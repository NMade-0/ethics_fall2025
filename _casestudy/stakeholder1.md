Workers are central stakeholders in the ethical discussion surrounding AI and job sustainability because they are the most directly affected by decisions to automate labor. While organizations may benefit from increased efficiency and reduced costs, workers face job loss, wage suppression, and growing job insecurity. For most individuals, employment is not only a source of income but also a source of identity, stability, and social participation. When AI systems replace or undermine human labor, workers bear the immediate economic and emotional consequences.

Additionally, workers often have little power or representation in decisions about AI adoption in the workplace. Unlike employers or policymakers, they are rarely consulted or given meaningful opportunities to influence how and when AI technologies are deployed. This lack of agency makes workers particularly vulnerable to harm and highlights the ethical responsibility of organizations and governments to consider worker protections, transparency, and retraining efforts when implementing AI systems.
